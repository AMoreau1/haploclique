#HaploClever
We present a novel method to reconstruct the structure of a viral quasispecies from NGS data.
Our approach can be used to:
 - reconstruct local error-corrected haplotypes and estimate their abundance
 - assemble full-length viral haplotypes
 - detect large deletions and insertions from paired-end data.
 
The source code and further information, how to apply this software package to your data will be available soon.
